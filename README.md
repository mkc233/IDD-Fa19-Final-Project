# IDD-Fa19-Final-Project

# Project Idea:

The goal of this project is to create a miniature arcade basketball game similar to the life size ones you see in arcades.  Users will be able to shoot miniature size basketballs into a hoop using a mini sized catapult.  The hoop will be able to move randomly as programmed.  There will also be a scoredboard which will keep track of the users score.  The scoreboard will also include a display for the timer to indicate how much longer the round will last.  There will also be a permanent leaderboard similar to arcades so the best of the best can show up their skills.

# Expected Parts:

1. Plastic (possibly 3D printed)/cardboard for the physical portion of the game (the catapult, the hoop, the court, the display housing)

2. Arduino

3. Some type of conveyor belt like part to move the basketball hoop on the x,y, and possibly z axis.

4. Display to show score, timer, high score

5. A couple of simple buttons to start the game, pause the game, restart the game.

6. Battery to power Arduino.

7. Potentially some speakers/LEDS to improve the aesthetics.

8. Motion sensor to detect made shots




# Interaction Plan:

Users will press a certain button to start the game.  Play the game, and then if they make it to the leaderboard they will be able to enter in their name.
