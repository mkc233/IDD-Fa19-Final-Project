# IDD-Fa19-Final-Project

# Project Idea:

The goal of this project is to create a miniature arcade basketball game similar to the life size ones you see in arcades.  Users will be able to shoot miniature size basketballs into a hoop using a mini sized catapult.  One player or two players will get to play against one another.  There will also be a scoredboard which will keep track of the users score.  The scoreboard will also include a display for the timer to indicate how much longer the round will last.  There will also be a permanent leaderboard similar to arcades so the best of the best can show off their skills.

# Expected Parts:

1. Plastic (possibly 3D printed)/cardboard for the physical portion of the game (the catapult, the hoop, the court, the display housing)

2. Arduino

3. Display to show score, timer, high score

4. A couple of simple buttons to start the game, pause the game, restart the game.

5. Battery to power Arduino.

6. Potentially some speakers/LEDS to improve the aesthetics.

7. Motion sensor to detect made shots




# Interaction Plan:

Users will press a certain button to start the game.  Play the game, and then if they make it to the leaderboard they will be able to enter in their name.
